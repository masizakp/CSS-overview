The goal of this task is to create a professional yet personal HTML webpage that serves as an online CV or portfolio. The focus is on structuring content, introducing interactive features using HTML forms, and presenting my background and contact information clearly. While visual styling using CSS will come later, the primary objective is to lay a solid foundation for one's personal brand online.
